### ITEM LIST SOURCE
If the item list is outdated, you can change it yourself. Just change the "ITEM LIST SOURCE" URL for that. 

Another good source is https://github.com/broderickhyman/ao-bin-dumps

Or you extract the files yourself from the game. More information can be found here: https://github.com/broderickhyman/ao-id-extractor
