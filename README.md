## SETTINGS 

### ITEM LIST SOURCE
If the item list is outdated, you can change it yourself. Just change the "ITEM LIST SOURCE" URL for that. 

Another good source is https://github.com/broderickhyman/ao-bin-dumps

Or you extract the files yourself from the game. More information can be found here: https://github.com/broderickhyman/ao-id-extractor


## Language translation

### How it works
To add your language, you only need to create or adapt a file in the `Languages` directory.
The file must always have the language code. 

Example:
```
en-US.xml
```

You can find language codes here: https://www.andiamo.co.uk/resources/iso-language-codes/

### Create file
Copy the en-US file and change everything, then all APP-CODES should be available. 
```
<translation name = "EVERY_3_DAYS">HERE YOUR TEXT</translation>
```
